## What is Dente Tempo?

Dente Tempo is an application I am currently implementing that features different web technologies, including React, TypeScript, NodeJS, and MongoDB. It is a timer that tracks how long I have removed my invisalign container from my mouth.

The site is fully responsive, as it is designed to look and function on mobile, tablet and desktop sized screens.

## Next Steps

Here are a few additional steps I would like to accomplish with this app:

- Deploy this site to a cloud platform for hosting
