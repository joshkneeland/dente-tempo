// NOTES

Setup:

1. Installed Docker on MAC
2. docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
3. docker run -d --name ms-sql-server -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=Valuetech@123' -p 1433:1433 mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest
    ms-sql-server -> name of the sql server
    -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -> env var accepting licensing agreement
    -e SA_PASSWORD=Valuetech@123 -> pw can be anything
    -p -> p stands for port 1433:1433
    mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-latest -> 
4. Open docker tab from top bar, you'll see port 1433 is now running

5. Download sample database
    AdventureWorks2017.bak (this matches what's showing inside Azure Data Studio)

6. In order for SQL server to access the .bak file
    sudo docker exec -it ms-sql-server mkdir var/opt/mssql/backup

    var/opt/mssql/backup -> system path that's accessible by ms-sql-server
        this is the file path where this backup directory will be created

7. sudo docker cp AdventureWorks2017.bak ms-sql-server:var/opt/mssql/backup
    Going to copy the AdventureWorks2017 db to this directory 

    sudo docker -> the command
    .bak -> the backup file
    copying file from the downloads folder to the file system within ms-sql-server

8. Go through the process of restoring the database

    Restoring is the process of copying data from a backup and applying logged transactions to the data. Restore is what you do with backups. Take the backup file and turn it back into a database.
